# oil painting website project

A web dev project using javascript+php, contains an art database that is accessible and builds a web page with CRUD functionality. In retrospect, the project would only serve archival purposes as the internal structure was quite antiquated. However, the art database could be repurposed into other projects because of its exquisite visuals. 

Certain files were reuploaded for better optimization in newer environments.
